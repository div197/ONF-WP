# ONF WP 1.0.0 Environment Configuration
# For a new project, you usually only need to change PROJECT_DOMAIN.

# -- Project Domain --
# This is how you'll access your WordPress site in the browser.
# MUST use this domain, not 'localhost'. Example: my-site.localhost
# IMPORTANT: For each new ONF WP project folder, make this UNIQUE!
PROJECT_DOMAIN=orangenetwork.foundation

# -- Web Server Ports --
# Change these if port 8000 or 8081 is already used on your computer.
TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT=8000
TRAEFIK_WEBUI_PORT=8081

# Database credentials are set directly in docker-compose.yml using the project folder
# name for basic uniqueness. This is for local development simplicity ONLY.
# Do NOT expose this setup directly to the internet without changing credentials
# and implementing proper security measures.
